PHONENOW TELECOM COMPANY ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION

In this three part project, I took on the role of a PwC consultant to a telecom company called PhoneNow. I was tasked with working with the call center manager, retention manager and human resource manager to draw insights from data in their respective department. This is in fulfillment of the PwC virtual job simulation tasks on Forage . The subsequent parts of this article cover each of the three parts of this project.

CALL CENTER.

Analysis goal:


Prepare a dashboard for the call center manager that demonstrates key insights from the Q1 data (2021) that are to be discussed in the meeting with management. This should primarily include agents' performance and customer satisfaction metrics and KPIs.

Key insights:

5000 customers called during the 3-month duration.

Only 80% of the calls were received 10% of which the caller’s inquiries/complaints/concerns were not resolved.

The topic that reported the highest rate of unresolved calls was streaming (12%) which was also the topic with the highest number of calls overall (1022).

The average satisfaction rate was 3.40 on a scale of 5 with January reporting the highest rating of 3.45.

The peak hours by number of calls were 13:00, 11:00 and 17:00.

The hours of the day with the highest number of unanswered calls were 12:00, 9:00 and 17:00.

The agent with the highest rating is Martha (3.45) and the agent with the lowest rating is Joe (3.33).

The agent with the highest number of answered calls is Jim (536) while the agent with the least is Stewart (477).

The agent with the highest rate of unanswered calls is Diane (21%).

Recommendations:


Adjust scheduling of agents to ensure that there are adequate agents available during the hours with the highest numbers of unanswered calls. i.e. 12:00, 9:00 and 17:00.

Provide additional training to agents to better equip them in handling inquiries with the highest rate of non-resolution such as streaming related inquiries.

CUSTOMER RETENTION

Analysis goal:


Understand the factors influencing customer churn so as to be more proactive in reducing the customer churn rate.

Key metrics:


They have had 7043 customers (churns – 1869, retained customers - 5174).

Customer retention rate is 73.5%, which means they are losing over a quarter of their customers.

Key insights:

The highest level of churn is observed within the first month (380) of the customers having a contract after which it drops by over half the rate (123 in month 2).

Customers with month-to-month subscription have the highest churn total (1655) in comparison to those with one-year (166) and two-year (48) contract basis. The customers with month-to-month subscription also incur the highest monthly charges of the three groups.

Based on service subscription, the highest churn rate (31.83%) was observed in customers with internet service subscription. Customers who have fiber optic internet service subscription have significantly higher churn total (1297) and monthly charges than those with DSL (459) internet services.

Customers that had streaming service subscription had the 2nd (TV – 30.07%)) and 3rd (Movies – 29.94%)) highest churn rate. In the call center analysis, we found that the highest non-resolution rate (12%) for calls made to the center were related to streaming services.

Customers with no dependents have a higher churn rate (31%) as opposed to those with dependents (15%).

Customers with no partner had a higher churn rate (32%) as opposed to customers with a partner (19%).

Customers that use electronic check payment method had the highest churn rate.

Recommendations:


With the first month of having a contract showing the highest churn rate, addressing this could account for a significant reduction in the churn rate. 100% of these customers have reached out for technical support which indicates a flaw in the service. Streaming related services have the highest churn rate for this period which suggests that this is the service that they may be requesting assistance with. Identifying and fixing the technical problem present in streaming service delivery should significantly reduce the churn rate. This could be done by acquiring and analyzing customer feedback from those who need support related to streaming services and doing diagnostic testing of the service.

PhoneNow should prioritize acquiring customers who have dependents and partners as they have a significantly lower churn rate than their counterparts.

Work with teams such as the sales & marketing, strategy and finance teams to identify relevant services that could be added to the fiber optic service package at no extra cost to the customers since they incur higher monthly charges than DSL service customers and have a much higher churn rate. This could increase their customer satisfaction rate and reduce the churn rate.

HUMAN RESOURCE

Analysis goal:


Understand current state of gender balance and investigate potential root causes for the slow progress towards achieving gender balance especially in managerial positions.

Key metrics:


500 employees total. 41% of the employees are female. 51% of the new hires within the last fiscal year are women. 35% of employees promoted within the last year are female. 44% of the turnover within the last year are female. Majority of the employees are within age groups 20-29 (223) and 30-39 (174).

KEY INSIGHTS.


Within age group 20-29, 46% of them are female all of whom are in either junior officer position(87) or senior officer(15). Within this age group there are no female employees in manager, senior manager, director and executive positions.

Regardless of age group 30-39 having the second highest number of employees (174) only 33% are female, with a ratio of 1:11(female to male) within the director job level.

The operations department is the best performing in terms of gender balance (49.26% are female). Majority of this are in the junior officer position (57% being female) and senior officer position (74% being female). Within managerial positions there is 33% female in manager, 22% female in senior manager, 10% female in director and no female in executive position. Similar pattern in composition is observed in other departments.

53% of employees in junior roles are female and this gender ration drops as you rise through the job level ranks all the way to only 15% at the highest job level which is executive. In total, female employees make up only 22% of employees within managerial positions i.e. manager, senior manager, director and executive positions.

Female employees make up 36% of full time employees while they account for 94% of part time employees.

Male employees have a significantly higher average performance rating that female employees within the strategy, finance and HR departments. Female employees have higher average performance ratings that male employees across all job levels except executive and senior officer positions.

100% of the new hires (< 1yr employment period) that have been promoted are male.

Recommendations:


Encourage and prioritize female candidates when hiring especially for managerial positions and full time positions.

Encourage and prioritize male candidates when hiring especially for part time positions to resolve the high imbalance in the gender ration for part time employees.

Prioritize qualifying female candidates when promoting employees to senior managerial positions.

Encourage and prioritize female candidates when hiring for roles within the strategy department especially for managerial positions since they currently have no female employee.
